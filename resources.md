# Potentially useful resources

Here:  
https://www.jstor.org/stable/20197096  
is an article from April 1958 issue of the journal "The Reading Teacher" titled "Phonetic Spelling for Better Reading?"

On the first page of that article one sentence says: 

> The prime emphasis of the outstanding spelling simplifiers of the United States and Great Britain has always been to eliminate the unnecessary waste of time in *learning to read* the English language.

Damn right! Eliminate the unnecessary waste of time in *learning to read* the English language! Apparently, in the 1950s (over half a century ago) there was an attempt to push for a spelling reform. But what did come out of it? Not even one tiny thing! ZERO!

Oh, and [this Wikipedia page on "English-language spelling reform"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-language_spelling_reform) starts with this sentence: 

> For centuries, there has been a movement to reform the spelling of the English language.

Aha... They are talking about **centuries** there!!!  
The incompetent idiots that are in charge everywhere have been preventing a spelling reform in English for CENTURIES already. Do you really think there could a spelling reform any time soon? 

**Not gonna happen!** Not in this century. Not in the next.

But that Wikipedia page is potentially a good resource to consider. 

In this [June 2019 article titled "Simpler spelling may be more relevant than ever"](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20190613-simpler-spelling-may-be-more-relevant-than-ever) the BBC says: 

> The complexity of English spellings has been bothering people for nearly as long as English has been written down. They argue that inconsistent spellings make English unnecessarily hard to learn.

Yeah, no shit!  
Tell me something I don't know. 

That's followed by: 

> Compared to the UK variants, US spellings are easier for non-native speakers to learn, being shorter and slightly more phonetic. These US spellings are a legacy of dictionary pioneer Noah Websterâ€™s movement for simplified spelling.

And here's the interesting bit: 

> There was a practical as well as a political element to this. Not only would learners find it easier to master simplified spellings, Webster reasoned, but humbler spellings were actually more democratic, and would help differentiate the Americans from their recent colonial masters across the pond.

AHA!  
*"[...] humbler spellings were actually more democratic"*, Webster reasoned! 

And why, exactly, was simpler spelling considered "more democratic"? 

Because it's **easier to bloody LEARN!**  
Simpler spelling makes it easy for EVERYONE to learn English. Not just for the rich aristocrats who could afford to hire a private tutor for their children. That's why! 

Oh, and my point to add to that is: 

It's not just about a private tutor being expensive. It's also about the children wasting their VALUABLE TIME when they could be spending that time learning something that's infinitely MORE VALUABLE than spelling. Like... SCIENCE, for example!

Bloody hell! This shit... this exteme level of stupidity really gets me agitated.
