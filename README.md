# Starlan: like English but 10 times faster to learn!

Starlan is a new human language based on and mutually intelligible with American English. Starlan makes it possible for non-native speakers (and for children) to **learn English up to 10 times faster** and to minimize accent from the start.
 
 In short: 
 
 ## Starlan is like American English in phonetic spelling
 
 Phonetic spelling means: words are spelled the same way they are pronounced. 
 
 On the flip side it means:  
 A new learner of Starlan can learn the basic pronunciation rules in about 30 minutes and **IMMEDIATELY know the correct pronunciation of any word in any text!** 
 
 Even without knowing that word's meaning.  
 And without ever having to look it up pronunciation. 
 
 
 This means, people speaking Starlan will: 
 * understand American English speakers perfectly and vice versa
 * learn flawless American English pronunciation up to 10 times faster
 * benefit from reduced miscommunication in personal interactions
 * have more time available to spend on more productive tasks
 * free up more mental capacity for developing new ideas
 
 
## Core premise and ideas

Originally, I conceived Starlan as the language for the citizens of Star City (see Star City Manifesto). And originally, I called it "Star English". But eventually, I realized that having the word "English" within the name would be counter-productive. 

Too many idiots would get triggered and try to waste our time if the name would indicate that it's "some new kind of English". So, I changed the name to Starlan, which is short for "star language". 

Just this simple change already gives us a lot more freedom. Freedom to change and adjust things the way we see fit. Because we don't even claim that Starlan *is* English. We just say that Starlan is *like* English. So, we can freely change things however the hell we want. 

And if, over time, Starlan starts deviating more and more from English, so be it! Since it doesn't have the word "English" anywhere in the name, we have the ultimate freedom to do the necessary changes. 

We just want it to be very close (in terms of pronunciation) to Standard American English at the beginning. So that new learners (and their teachers) around the world quickly realize how vastly superior Starlan is compared to American English. 

At a certain point, most educators and schools around the world will realize that teaching Starlan (instead of American or British English) is better because machines can convert any English text to Starlan in a heartbeat. And Starlan is mutually intelligeble with English but up to 10 times easier and faster for people to learn. 

### Basic premise

#### Don't rely on idiots. Start doing the right thing NOW! 

There are too many incompetent idiots in charge. Everywhere.

That's the basic premise and the reason for building Star City. But instead of complaining about incompetent idiots being in charge everywhere, we just want to build a new, independent city-state. A new country on the map. With our own laws and rules. And we'll put measures in place to continuously weed out incompetent idiots. Because just like weed, idiots will continuously be popping up everywhere. That's inevitable. But we'll have a system to keep that weed in check. See **"the Peter Principle"** for more information on this institutional "illness". 

TODO:  
Develop a system that **systematically prevents** incompetent people from rising to the top AND **systematically weeds out** incompetent people who still manage to rise to the top. A system like this will probably never be 100% effective (nothing ever is). But if we could consistently weed out 80% or maybe even 90% incompetent people from top positions in Star City, we'll be way ahead of anyone else. 

### Communication is key!

Communication is super-important when building a new mega-city designed to make the world a better place. And not just that. Star City aims to become the undisputed world leader in science and technology. Using science and technology we aim to turn this 100-million-people-strong mega-city into the greenest, most sustainable and most fun mega-city on the planet.

But to get there, we need to use every advantage we can get. 

One crucial aspect of this mega-project will be communication. Communication between people. Communication between people who work for Star City. Communication between people who want to help. 

### What hinders communication?

If communication is key to success, then what hinders communication? 

When a speaker is difficult to understand due to accent, that hinders communication and understanding. 

When a non-native speaker has difficulty learning correct pronunciation, that hinders communication and increases the wasted time that person has to spend on learning the language. 

When the correct pronunciation is unclear (because of weird spelling) and the person has to look the correct pronunciation up, that hinders communication and understanding. 

### The solution?

The obvious solution is to REMOVE the barriers, remove the obstacles, remove the annoyances, remove the problems that make it harder for people to learn a language, harder to learn the correct pronunciation of a language, harder to learn the correct spelling of a language. 

That solution is so obvious that even a blind should be able to see it. 

### How does English fit into it?

If it wasn't for the horrendous spelling nightmare, English would be one of the easiest languages to learn. So, we'll be fixing this problem and we'll call this fix **Starlan** AKA Star Language. 

Relying on someone else to fix the spelling problem in English is a pipe dream. That's never gonna happen. And even if it somehow miracolously does happen, it will inevitably be watered down to the point of being useless. 

No matter what arguments you bring to incompetent idiots who are in charge, those idiots will prevail. So, we won't even discuss anything with those idiots. They can keep their English the way it is and we'll be using Starlan in Star City. End of story! Easy peasy. 

### Don't waste time battling idiots

Because the name Starlan doesn't mention the word "English" anywhere in its name, incompetent idiots don't have any business telling us what we can and can't do with Starlan. For all they know, it's a **NEW LANGUAGE**. So, we can do anything we want. 

The intelligent question now is: 

### What should we do?

1. Create a phonetic spelling version of American English.

2. Call that **Starlan**.

That's it! Done.

Of course, it's easier said than done. 

And of course, we might have a few exceptions here and there. At least in Starlan version 1.

And once we get at least 100 million people to speak and write Starlan, we can discuss the possibility of developing Starlan version 2. But we gotta start somewhere. 

Even if people have to learn a few exceptions in Starlan version 1, there shouldn't be more than 1-2 hours needed to learn those exceptions. 3 hours tops. And that means: even Starlan version 1 will be **light years ahead** of American English in terms of ease of use and ease of learning!

And that in turn means:  
New learners of Starlan will save HUNDREDS or possibly THOUSANDS of hours learning the new language. And they'll be able to know the correct pronunciation of every word from DAY ONE! Just by reading!

Just by reading a book or a newspaper, people will instantly know the correct pronunciation of EVERY word. From DAY ONE. Without looking anything up! 

Of course, the mouth and the tongue of a new learner will need some time (a few days or a few weeks) to actually learn to pronounce the sounds correctly. But regardless of that, new speakers of Starlan will know, from DAY ONE and with 100% certainty (without looking it up) how any given word written in Starlan is **supposed to be pronounced**, how it's **supposed to sound**. 

THAT's the big difference here!

A new learner of Starlan will also be able to immediately look up the **meaning** of a word they hear from someone. Because just by hearing the correct pronunciation of a word, a new learner will immediately know the correct or likely spelling of that word!

 And since looking up the meaning of an unknown word will become so much easier, people — once again — will learn this new language FASTER!

At this point, nobody really knows how much faster people will be able to learn Starlan. Plus, that will depend on the learner's mother tongue. But it's quite possible that new learners whose native language is something like German or Swedish or Dutch might be able to learn Starlan 10 times faster than American English. Or, potentially, even faster than that!

Oh, and children who are being tortured — for years — with the English spelling at school, won't be subjected to this torture anymore because they'll immediately know how to spell everything they say. 

And that means:  
These children... the new generation will have much more of their mental power freed up to learn SCIENCE!!! 

And of course, learning science cannot be just another torture for children! Learning science for children must be made so fun and exciting that they'd rather do that than playing video games. But this is a completely separate topic. In Star City, world's best education for children (for every child) will be priority number one! It has to be if Star City is to become the undisputed world leader in science and technology.
