# Starlan: like English but 10 times faster to learn!

Starlan is a new human language based on and mutually intelligible with American English. Starlan makes it possible for non-native speakers (and for children) to **learn English up to 10 times faster** and to minimize accent from the start.
 
 In short: 
 
 ## Starlan is like American English in phonetic spelling
 
 Phonetic spelling means: words are spelled the same way they are pronounced. 
 
 On the flip side it means:  
 A new learner of Starlan can learn the basic pronunciation rules (and main exceptions) in about 30 minutes and **IMMEDIATELY be able to read any text with correct pronunciation!** 
 
 Even without knowing a word's meaning, a new learner will immediately know the correct pronunciation without ever having to look it up. 
 
 
 This means, people speaking Starlan will: 
 * understand American English speakers perfectly and vice versa
 * learn flawless American English pronunciation up to 10 times faster
 * benefit from reduced miscommunication in personal interactions
 * have more time available to spend on more productive tasks
 * free up more mental capacity for developing new ideas
 
 
## Core premise and ideas

Originally, I conceived Starlan as the language for the citizens of Star City (see Star City Manifesto). And originally, I called it "Star English". But eventually, I realized that having the word "English" within the name would be counter-productive. 

Too many idiots would get triggered and try to waste our time if the name would indicate that it's "some new kind of English". So, I changed the name to Starlan, which is short for "star language". 

Just this simple change already gives us a lot more freedom. Freedom to change and adjust things the way we see fit. Because we don't even claim that Starlan *is* English. We just say that Starlan is *like* English. So, we can freely change things however the hell we want. 

And if, over time, Starlan starts deviating more and more from English, so be it! Since it doesn't have the word "English" anywhere in the name, we have the ultimate freedom to do the necessary changes. 

We just want it to be very close (in terms of pronunciation) to Standard American English at the beginning. So that new learners (and their teachers) around the world quickly realize how vastly superior Starlan is compared to American English. 

At a certain point, most educators and schools around the world will realize that teaching Starlan (instead of American or British English) is better because machines can convert any English text to Starlan in a heartbeat. And Starlan is mutually intelligeble with English but up to 10 times easier and faster to learn. 

### Basic premise

#### Don't rely on idiots for anything. Start doing what needs to be done NOW! 

There are too many incompetent idiots in charge. Everywhere.

That's the basic premise and the reason for building Star City. Instead of complaining about incompetent idiots being in charge everywhere, we just want to build a new, independent city-state. A new country on the map. With our own laws and rules. And we'll put measures in place to continuously weed out incompetent idiots. Because just like weed idiots will continuously be popping up everywhere. That's inevitable. But we'll have a system to keep that weed in check. 

So:  
Communication is super-important when building a mega-city designed to make the world a better place. If it wasn't for the horrendous spelling nightmare, English would be one of the easiest languages to learn. So, we'll be fixing this problem and we'll call this fix Starlan AKA Star Language. 

Relying on someone else to fix the spelling problem in English is a pipe dream. That's never gonna happen. No matter what arguments you bring to incompetent idiots, those idiots will always prevail. So, we won't even discuss anything with those retards. They can keep their English the way it is and we'll be using Starlan. End of story! Easy peasy. 

#### Don't waste any time battling retards

Because the name Starlan doesn't mention the word "English" anywhere in its name, incompetent idiots don't have any business telling us what we can and can't do with Starlan. For all they know, it's a **NEW LANGUAGE**. So, we can do anything we want. 

The intelligent question now is:  
What should we do?
